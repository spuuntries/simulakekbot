# Simulacra Aesthetic Captions Bot (Simulakek fork)

## Introduction

This discord bot is used for collecting the Simulacra Aesthetic Captions dataset, a
public domain collection of prompts, AI generated imagery, and human aesthetic feedback
for use in training [Instruct-like](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) aesthetic models
to guide AI generated imagery into better satisfying human preferences. The dataset
could also be used to train a prompt generator or recommendation system.

## Installation

You can do the same instructions specified in upstream repo,
OR run the colab notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/spuuntries/simulakekbot/blob/imagen/simulakek.ipynb). 
(I recommend using a fresh bot token for this.)
